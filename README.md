# Youtube-Adview
This project predicts how many views a YouTube ad might get based on its metadata â€” like the title length, video category, duration, likes, dislikes, comments, and when it was uploaded. It uses machine learning models to find patterns that influence ad performance, helping creators and marketers make smarter, data-driven decisions.
